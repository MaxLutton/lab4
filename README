This distribution contains 5 files:
    2 .c source files
    lab4a.c:
        This program reads the current temperature every 1 second,
	and prints it to log1 and stdout. The code for this came from
	a combination of edison tutorials and a grove tutorial.
    lab4b.c:
        This program reads the current temperature and sends it to a
	server while also receiving commands from the server. It
	treats the display command as an invalid command. It also
	prints the temperature and commands received to a log file
	log2.
   2 log files, as described above,
   1 Makefile
       This has 3 targets:
           build: This compiles the 2 .c files.
	   clean: This removes the 2 log files and 2 executable files
	   created by the executables and the build target,
	   respectively.
	   dist: This creates this compressed tar folder.


    I did not implement the extra credit, so neither lab4a nor
    lab4b will print to the LCD. Also, lab4b will treat any
    display command as invalid, writing it to the log2 file with
    an 'I' appended to it.
